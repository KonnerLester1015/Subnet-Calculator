# Subnet Calculator

This project provides a subnet calculator implemented using Python and HTML/CSS. It allows users to input various network parameters and calculate subnet-related information.

## Features

- **Python Implementation**: The subnet calculations are performed using Python scripts.
- **HTML/CSS Interface**: The user interface is built using HTML and styled with CSS for a visually appealing experience.
- **Interactive**: Users can input host IP address, major network mask, subnet mask, and nth number of usable subnets, along with additional options such as all 0's subnet usability and all 1's subnet usability.

## Usage

To use the subnet calculator:

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Input the form parameters.
4. Click the "SUBMIT" button to calculate subnet information.
5. View the calculated subnet information displayed on the screen.

## File Structure

- **`main.py`**: Contains Python functions for subnet calculations.
- **`index.html`**: HTML file for the user interface.
- **`styles.css`**: CSS file for styling the interface.
- **`pyscript.toml`**: Configuration file for PyScript, a Python-to-JavaScript transpiler used in this project.

## Dependencies

- **PyScript**: PyScript is used for integrating Python code with HTML. It requires an internet connection to load the necessary scripts.
